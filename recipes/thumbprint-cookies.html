        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            My mother, Pauline, made really nice thumbprint cookies, but I never wrote down her recipe. I knew the ingredients, but unless you have the right proportions, you won't get that perfect melt-in-your-mouth texture. So, I did an image search and found a recipe that looked very similar, credited to a great-grandma named Mitzi. Since my last name is Mitzewich, that pretty much sealed the deal. In case you can't decide between a shortbread-focused cookie and a jammier one, here's how to make both.
        </p>
    
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <h4>Cookies</h4>
            <li>⅓ cup unsifted powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon fine salt</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon almond extract</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>⅓ cup white sugar, or as needed</li>
            <li>½ cup fruit jam, divided</li>
    
            <h4>Icing</h4>
            <li>1 cup powdered sugar, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon milk, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix together powdered sugar and butter in a large bowl with a rubber spatula until creamy. Add egg yolk, vanilla, salt, and almond extract; mix well. Blend in flour until just combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use a sorbet scoop to portion dough into 1/2-ounce (about 1 tablespoon) balls. Roll each ball in a plate of white sugar to coat; roll again between your palms. Place several inches apart on the prepared baking sheet. Flatten balls lightly with your fingers.
            </li>
            <li>
                For jammier cookies, skip to Step 7. For shortbread-type cookies, poke a well into each ball using a finger or the end of a thick wooden spoon dusted with powdered sugar. Fill wells with fruit jam. Tap the baking sheet against the counter to let jam settle.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until the tops are barely blonde and bottoms are slightly golden, about 15 minutes. Let cool completely on a wire rack before icing.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make icing: Place powdered sugar in a small bowl. Add milk, a little at a time, until icing reaches a consistency that will hold its shape when piped. Pipe over cookies in a zigzag pattern. Let sit for 15 minutes before serving.
            </li>
            <li>
                Press thumb into each ball to make a large, shallow indentation. Spoon in jam. Tap the baking sheet against the counter to let jam settle.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until light golden brown, about 15 minutes. Let cookies rest on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Dust with powdered sugar.
